  <h1>About me</h1>
  <p>
    I am a PhD candidate in the graduate group of Epidemiology. I'm just starting on creating this site to keep track of things like R code snippets, etc that help me with my PhD project and beyond. My background is that of a Veterinarian, though I am keen on amalgamating my Veterinary and Epidemiology knowledge with programming...so please bear with me as I find my way in this world of github, jekyll, programming, and contributing positively to this planet!
<br><br>    
    As of now, I am working on spatial analyses of infectious agents, and developing tools to help my research group manipulate project data.
<br><br>    
    I will update this site incrementally, so that I can balance it with my ongoing PhD work.
